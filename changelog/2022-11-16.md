# Create a WIP Version of the website
I created only the bare minimum so I could finally see something in my new domain,
I'm using 11ty mainly because I've tried different static generators and this one
felt easier but flexible at the same time

# Netlify deploy
I'm using Netlify because it is:
1. Free
2. Easy - it took me 2 minutes to get this deployed

# Changelog
So [Linear](https://linear.app/changelog) has this cool changelog page and I wanted one as well
